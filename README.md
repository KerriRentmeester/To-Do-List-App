# **Project Name**:  

To Do App

# **Description**: 

The To Do App project is a simple React app where one can Create tasks for their to do list, Remove tasks, and Delete tasks.

The To Do App project requires knowledge and skill in the following areas:  HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React. This project is a reflection of my coding capabilities, and as such, it is one component of my professional portfolio. This particular project is based off of a similar activity I worked on in July of 2023 from the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."
